//! Native QF Event Queue class
/// @description
/// This structure describes the native QF event queue, which can be used as
/// the event queue for active objects, or as a simple "raw" event queue for
/// thread-safe event passing among non-framework entities, such as ISRs,
/// device drivers, or other third-party components.@n
/// @n
/// The native QF event queue is configured by defining the macro
/// #QF_EQUEUE_TYPE as QP::QEQueue in the specific QF port header file.@n
/// @n
/// The QP::QEQueue class contains only data members for managing an event
/// queue, but does not contain the storage for the queue buffer, which must
/// be provided externally during the queue initialization.@n
/// @n
/// The event queue can store only event pointers, not the whole events. The
/// internal implementation uses the standard ring-buffer plus one external
/// location that optimizes the queue operation for the most frequent case
/// of empty queue.@n
/// @n
/// The QP::QEQueue class is used with two sets of functions. One set is for
/// the active object event queue, which needs to block the active object
/// task when the event queue is empty and unblock it when events are posted
/// to the queue. The interface for the native active object event queue
/// consists of the following functions: QP::QMActive::post(),
/// QP::QMActive::postLIFO(), and QP::QMActive::get_(). Additionally the
/// function QP::QEQueue::init() is used to initialize the queue.@n
/// @n
/// The other set of functions, uses this class as a simple "raw" event
/// queue to pass events between entities other than active objects, such as
/// ISRs. The "raw" event queue is not capable of blocking on the get()
/// operation, but is still thread-safe because it uses QF critical section
/// to protect its integrity. The interface for the "raw" thread-safe queue
/// consists of the following functions: QP::QEQueue::post(),
/// QP::QEQueue::postLIFO(), and QP::QEQueue::get(). Additionally the
/// function QP::QEQueue::init() is used to initialize the queue.@n
/// @n
/// @note Most event queue operations (both the active object queues and
/// the "raw" queues) internally use  the QF critical section. You should be
/// careful not to invoke those operations from other critical sections when
/// nesting of critical sections is not supported.
