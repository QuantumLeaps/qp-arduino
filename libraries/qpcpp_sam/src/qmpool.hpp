/// structure for dynamic allocation of fixed block-size chunks of memory.
/// A memory pool offers fast and deterministic allocation and recycling of
/// memory blocks and is not subject to fragmenation.@n

/// used as the event pool for dynamic event allocation, or as a fast,
/// deterministic fixed block-size heap for any other objects in your
/// application.

/// @note
/// The QP::QMPool class contains only data members for managing a memory
/// pool, but does not contain the pool storage, which must be provided
/// externally during the pool initialization.
///
/// @note
/// The native QF event pool is configured by defining the macro
/// #QF_EPOOL_TYPE_ as QP::QMPool in the specific QF port header file.
