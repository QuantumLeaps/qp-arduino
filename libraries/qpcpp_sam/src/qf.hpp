/// @description
/// Time events are special QF events equipped with the notion of time
/// passage. The basic usage model of the time events is as follows. An
/// active object allocates one or more QTimeEvt objects (provides the
/// storage for them). When the active object needs to arrange for a timeout,
/// it arms one of its time events to fire either just once (one-shot) or
/// periodically. Each time event times out independently from the others,
/// so a QF application can make multiple parallel timeout requests (from the
/// same or different active objects). When QF detects that the appropriate
/// moment has arrived, it inserts the time event directly into the
/// recipient's event queue. The recipient then processes the time event just
/// like any other event.@n
/// @n
/// Time events, as any other QF events derive from the QP::QEvt base
/// class. Typically, you will use a time event as-is, but you can also
/// further derive more specialized time events from it by adding some more
/// data members and/or specialized functions that operate on the specialized
/// time events.@n
/// @n
/// Internally, the armed time events are organized into a bi-directional
/// linked list. This linked list is scanned in every invocation of the
/// QP::QF::tickX_() function. Only armed (timing out) time events are in the
/// list, so only armed time events consume CPU cycles.
