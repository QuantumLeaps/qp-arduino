Version 1.1, 22 June 2016

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This QP-nano Framework Exception for Arduino ("Exception") is an
additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public
License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to the QP-nano source code
(the "QP-nano Framework") that is distributed as part of the
QP-Arduino Support Package.

When you use QP-nano Framework inside your program, the QP-nano
framework code is combined with your code of the program. The purpose
of this Exception is to allow non-GPL (including proprietary)
programs to use, in this way, the QP-nano Framework code covered
by this Exception.

0. Definitions.
"QP-nano Framework for Arduino" is a lightweight real-time framework,
as well as all supporting ports and examples, as distributed from:
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files> and
<https://github.com/QuantumLeaps>

"Arduino-Certified Board" means any board with an Arduino-supported
CPU that bears an official Arduino logo and/or is officially
certified under the Arduino Certified Program
(see <http://arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified>).

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler and linker in
executable form suitable for execution by an embedded microcontroller.


1. Grant of Additional Permission
As a special Exception, the copyright holder of QP-nano gives you
permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining
the QP-nano Framework with your own source code without the requirement
to expose your propriatory source code, provided that all Target Code
will execute on Arduino-Certified Board(s).

2. No Weakening of GPL
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the GPLv3 license.
