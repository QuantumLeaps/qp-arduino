This README provides a quick overview of QP for Arduino.
Please refer to the companion webiste to this project at:

----
# Software Installation

The QP adaptation for Arduino is distributed in a single ZIP
archive `qp-<ver>_arduino-1.8.x.zip`, where `<ver>` stands for
the version of the QP frameworks.

You need to unzip the `qp-<ver>_arduino-1.8.x.zip` archive into your
Arduino `<Sketchbook>` folder. To find out where your `<Sketchbook>` folder
is, or to configure a different location for your `<Sketchbook>` folder,
you need to open the Arduino IDE and select `File|Preferences` menu.
The Sketchbook location will be shown at the top of the Preferences
dialog box. Once you identify the `<Sketchbook>` folder, you simply unzip
the whole `qp-<ver>_arduino-1.8.x.zip` archive to this folder.

----
# Provided Libraries and Examples

The archive `qp-<ver>_arduino-1.8.x.zip` contains two external libraries
for SAM-based Arduinos:

- `qpcpp_sam` -- QP/C++ framework for SAM-based Arduinos
- `qpn_avr`   -- QP-nano framework for AVR-based Arduinos
                 
NOTE: qpn_avr is now obsolete. It is provided for backgwards compatibility only!
 
----
# Provided Tools

The archive also contains the QM modeling tool for Windows

- `qm`        -- QM modeling tool for Windows 32/64-bit

----
# Directories and Files

After the installation, your Arduino `<Sketchbook>` folder should look
as follows:

    <Sketchbook>/             - your Arduino Sketchbook folder
     |

NOTE: The QP-Arduino archive contains QM for the platform of your choice
(Windows, Linux or macOS), but this requires downloading the corresponding
version of the QP-Arduino integration.


----
# Working with the Examples

Assumming that you have installed the QP library in your `<Sketchbook>`
folder, the examples provided in each QP library show up in the Arduino
IDE under the menu:

`File|Examples|Examples from Custom Libraries`

The intended way of working with the examples is to use the
[QM modeling tool](https://www.state-machine.com/products/qm/) to modify
the **models** (`.qm` files) and then to **generate code** from these
models. In this scenario, the Arduino IDE is used only to build and
upload the code to the Arduino board(s).

> **NOTE:** The preferences in the Arduino IDE should be set up to
**Use external editor** so that the IDE will update the code each time
it is re-generated by the QM modeling tool.


----
# Example Documentation

Each example model has documentation, which you can view in the QM tool.
The model documentation shows in the Property Editor when the model item
is active.


----
# Licensing

The QP/C++ real-time embedded framework (RTEF) for Arduino are licensed
under the modified GPLv3 license with the
[QP-Arduino Exception](https://www.state-machine.com/licensing/QP-Arduino_GPL_Exception.txt)
(see also the file QP-Arduino_GPL_Exception.txt in the root of the archive).
Specifically, the Exception removes the requirement to expose your
propriatory source code as long as you deploy it on an Arduino-Certified
board.

The [QM model-based design tool](https://www.state-machine.com/qm/) is freeware.
The QM tool is provided under the terms of a simple
[End-User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.state-machine.com/qm/license.html).
